# OpenMap changelog

## Unreleased

## v0.7.4-beta (2026-10-23)

### New

- **Chat over the full-screen map** (the menu's Look tab, and Options): the chat windows stay on show
  over the map while it's full screen, to keep talking while you look. Off unless you turn it on (a
  player's request).
- **Faster to load**: only your language's translations are read (the other nine were a quarter of
  OpenMap's code), and its look through every addon's map icons for combat waits till you're in the
  world, not the loading screen (a player's report: half a second more load time).
- **The zones' detail comes in sooner** when the map first opens up close: it took a couple of
  seconds after a login or reload.
- **`/openmap status` says what loading costs**: OpenMap's files, the login, the map's setup and
  building the map (a player found it added load time: this shows where).

## v0.7.3-beta (2026-10-22)

### New

- **Key bindings** (the game's Keybindings > OpenMap): Find me, Drop a pin, Pins, Quill,
  Quest log and the map's menu, each opening the map first if it's closed (players' requests).
- **The quill draws on dungeons' maps**: with a dungeon's map up, what you draw goes on its picture
  and is kept with that dungeon, not on the world map behind it (a player's request).
- **Only places you've found** (the menu's On the map tab, under Places): dungeon entrances, docks
  and zeppelin towers once you've explored where they are, flight masters once you've learned them.
  Off unless you turn it on (a player's request).
- **Townsfolk from another addon's NPC database**: an addon with a database in Questie's shape can
  give it to OpenMap (`OpenMapAPI.RegisterTownsfolkProvider`, docs/api.md), so townsfolk and rare
  mobs show without Questie (a player's request).

### Fixed

- **Smooth zooming at any Take colour out**: the zones' fast pre-drawn art was only used at the
  setting's default (10%); at any other, every zone was drawn from its hundreds of pieces and the
  frame rate dropped as their detail came in. It's now used at every setting.
- **Full screen stays full screen**, and the quest log you closed stays closed, the next time the
  map opens: it went back to the window and the quest log each time (a player's report).
- **Improves performance** under Fade icons while zooming no longer stays on show over the menu's
  other tabs (a player's report).
- **Riverglades and Zephras Isle show their levels** on the zone hover (35-45 and 1-12, from the
  Warcraft Wiki; a player's report).

## v0.7.2-beta (2026-10-21)

### Improved

- **Zooming is smoother with unexplored areas darkened**: greying the land you haven't found cost
  a lot of frame rate while zooming; it now costs far less.
- **Unexplored areas for one character only**: the menu's **Only for this character**, under
  Unexplored areas, gives this character its own choice (darkened, hidden or shown); every other
  character keeps the shared one (a player's request).
- **Fade icons while zooming** says **Improves performance** under it in the map's menu, so it
  isn't turned off unawares.

### Fixed

- **The map loads the zone you pan or zoom to again**: with an addon adding map icons (Questie,
  GatherLite ...), it could stay on the zone you started on, so the zone or continent you'd panned to
  showed none of their icons until you clicked it (a player's report from 0.6, and ours). Its setting,
  once Follow the view, is now **Load the zone in view** (the menu's More tab), saying what it does.
- **The map window drags and resizes with Move Any installed but turned off**: OpenMap asked whether
  Move Any was on for a character named by your first name alone (WoW Forever gives a first and last
  name), which the game took as on, and left the window to it (a player's report, with the fix).

## v0.7.1-beta (2026-10-21)

### Improved

- **Darkened unexplored areas look better** (Unexplored areas: Darken): a **Darkening** slider (the
  menu's sliders, and Options) sets how dark they are, from a light shade to the full one; unfound
  land is greyed as well as darkened, so the lighter lines Blizzard paints along zones' borders no
  longer show bright through it; neighbouring zones you haven't found blend into one another, with
  no light seams between them, and the painted land between zones (north of the Plaguelands,
  Gilneas, round Ahn'Qiraj ...) darkens with them.
- **Other addons' icons fade while you zoom** (Questie's, RestedXP's ...), out as a zoom starts and
  back in after it, instead of blinking off and on. **Fade icons while zooming**, in the map's menu
  (the Show tab), turns it off.
- **The map window can go partly off the screen**: drag it up until its title and the bar under it
  are past the top, for just the map (Options' Reset window brings it back), or past the sides and
  bottom while some of it stays on.
- **With Enhance QoL**, OpenMap says once in chat to turn off its Mover > World Map: the two both
  size the map, and its scale goes wrong (a player's finding).

### Fixed

- **Other addons' icons stay on the map** (RestedXP's, Nauticus's, Questie's ...): they could
  flicker and go, as anything that set the map's scale counted as zooming. Now only your own
  zooming does, and never for more than a moment.
- **Flight masters you've learned are in colour**, all of them: OpenMap knew only the ones it had
  seen you visit since it was installed (and, on a client not in English, none). It now asks the
  game which you've found.
- **Fishing on the zone hover** shows: OpenMap looked for your Fishing skill in a way WoW Forever no
  longer offers, and found none.
- **Zeppelin towers show for the Alliance too** when Zeppelins is on: they were the Horde's only,
  though their routes showed for everyone and the goblins' zeppelins take anyone.

## v0.7.0-beta (2026-10-20)

### New

- **Fishing on the zone hover**: if you know Fishing, hovering a zone shows the skill at which every
  cast there lands (Elwynn Forest 25, Hillsbrad Foothills 150, Stranglethorn Vale 225 ...), green if
  you have it, yellow if most casts land, red if most get away. With **Zone levels**, from the
  original game's values; WoW Forever's own zones have none yet.
- **Shortest Path Forever from anywhere on the map**: Shift-click a spot in another zone, on
  another continent or zoomed right out over the whole world, and its journey is planned there. Its
  own Shift-click only reached the map underneath (the zone or continent you were last zoomed into).
- **NeedRoll opens where you click**: a boss in a dungeon's Bosses tab opens NeedRoll on that boss's
  loot (Shift-click: where the boss is, on NeedRoll's map of the dungeon), and a quest in the Quests
  tab opens its page there; the Loot tab's button opens the dungeon's own loot. Dire Maul's, Scarlet
  Monastery's, Stratholme's and Blackrock Spire's wings open on the right one. Needs NeedRoll's
  newest version (thanks to its author, mikebvs, for the links).

### Improved

- **Choose your map**: the choice the first time the map opens is in the map window's own frame,
  with plainer words.
- **The map stays open while you talk to an NPC** (or open a vendor, the bags' windows ...): the
  windowed map is no longer put away to make room. Escape still closes it; maximized, it behaves as
  before.
- **Reopen map: Center on player, keep zoom** (the menu's Reopen map, and Options): the map opens
  on you at the zoom you closed it at.

### Fixed

- **Ironforge's map shows once you've been there**, even if you came by the Deeprun Tram and haven't
  found the land round it yet. With unexplored areas hidden, the city counted as found only once you'd
  explored the part of Dun Morogh over it; now going into a city finds it too.

## v0.6.0-beta (2026-10-18)

### New

- **Responsive ocean & border** (Options, and the map's menu): zoomed right out, the world map lies
  on a sea chart painted by Santiago Reyes (used with his permission), laid out for your window's
  shape: the sea, compass roses, sea creatures, ships and the frame's corners round it, each in its
  place whether the window is wide, square or tall. The game's own world map stays in the middle,
  fading into his sea. Zoom out past the whole world to see all of it; the map pans to its edges and
  no further. Off unless you turn it on. Its frame is the map's only border now: the parchment
  border and its setting are gone, so with this off the map has none.
- **OpenMap in your language**: German, French, Spanish (Spain and Latin America), Italian,
  Portuguese (Brazil), Russian, Korean and Chinese (Simplified and Traditional), with the game's own
  words for things (flight masters, map pins, the quest log ...). Place names were already the
  game's. What's new's notes stay in English.
- **Your quests from every zone, at any zoom**: Blizzard's map shows a zone's quests only once
  you've zoomed in on that zone; now the quests in your log show across the whole map, in the look
  of Blizzard's (in progress or ready to turn in, their objectives on hover; click one: it opens in
  the quest log). The menu's **Quests from every zone** turns them off.
- **Every cave underground**: the caves, mines, tunnels, crypts, dens and dungeon entrances Blizzard
  drew no map of (about 250 of them; it drew 39) surface as you zoom in on them too, as the game's
  own minimap draws them inside, lying as they do: Fargodeep's neighbours, Dun Algaz's tunnel, the
  troll and kobold caves, the ogre mounds, Razorfen Kraul's, Blackfathom's and Onyxia's Lair's
  entrances, and WoW Forever's own new caves and vaults.
- **Ten more gaps painted**: the blank land between zones is painted by hand by Santiago Reyes
  (used with his permission) round Tanaris and Silithus, the Plaguelands, Stonetalon and the
  Barrens, Silverpine and Hillsbrad, Thousand Needles and Feralas, Winterspring and Darkshore,
  Ashenvale and Azshara, Stranglethorn and the Blasted Lands, Thousand Needles and Dustwallow
  Marsh, and Desolace and Feralas. Their coasts are his own coastlines, fading out into the sea.
  Khaz Modan's comes back sharper, from his full-size painting.
  Options' **Filled gaps** turns them all off.
- **Map pins into chat**: Shift-click a pin (on the map or in the Pins list) to put it in chat, as
  Blizzard's map pin link where the game takes one (whoever clicks it gets the waypoint), with its
  note; else its note, zone and position as text.
- **Clearing map pins**: the Pins list's **Clear** deletes every pin (it asks first), and Alt-click
  deletes one at once, on the map or in the list.
- **Hiding your map pins**: right-click **Pins** (in the OpenMap menu, or its button on the map) and
  your pins leave the map, the button greyed while they're away; right-click again for them back.
  The Pins list still has them all, and dropping a new pin brings them back.
- **Mailboxes** in the menu's Townsfolk (from Questie's list of them, as its own map shows them).
- **Icon size** (the menu's sliders, and Options): OpenMap's icons on the map bigger or smaller.
- **Credits** (What's new's **Credits** button): who has made OpenMap, Santiago Reyes's painted
  maps, Ironship's and C-Clymer's work on the code, Blizzard's art, the libraries, and everyone who
  reports problems and ideas.

### Improved

- **Smoother zooming with Questie**: other addons' map icons (Questie's, TomTom's ...) rest while
  the map zooms and come back as soon as it stops. Each was laid out again on every frame of a zoom,
  which with Questie's hundreds cost a lot of frame rate. Options' **Other addons' icons rest while
  zooming** keeps them up.
- **In combat, fewer "action blocked" errors** from the map's own icons: the super-trackable ones
  (quests, points of interest) wait out combat to set their clicks, as the rest already did, and
  addons loaded later are covered too. Other addons' icons lifted over the map (Leatrix Maps',
  Azeroth Tripview's, Books on Map Forever's) are lifted as combat ends, not during it.
  **RareScanner's** rare icons show over the map (they were under its art). A map addon with a
  HereBeDragons OpenMap can't take over is said once in chat, not passed over. Thanks to Ironship.
- **Questie's icons across the view**: zoomed out over a zone, the quests of every zone in view show,
  not only those of the zone underneath and the next one.
- **Shortest Path Forever works on the map**: Shift-click the map to plan a journey (OpenMap's
  click-to-zoom took every click first).
- **The map opens no further in than the deepest zoom**: centred on you in a city, it opened as far
  in as the city's map fits (up to half again past the setting, and blurry past the art's own pixels).
- **The menu's buttons on the map come off with Shift-right-click** only, not a plain right-click.
- **For other addons**: `OpenMapAPI.CursorPosition()` (API version 3), the point under the cursor;
  with `MapAt`, the zone under it at any zoom, so a zone-hover tooltip (Zonewise's) can keep working
  zoomed in, where the map underneath is the zone, not the continent.
- **The Pins list** can be dragged anywhere and stays where you put it. Sharing every pin is one
  **Share all** button with a menu (as a code, to your group, to your guild), so sending them all to
  your guild is never one stray click.
- **The minimap's detail over Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff** as over the other major cities (up to
  half strength; it was held to 15% there, which hardly showed). **Minimap detail in major cities**
  (the menu's Up close, and Options) turns it off over all six.

### Fixed

- **With a controller (the game's Gamepad UI), OpenMap leaves the world map to Blizzard.** Closing
  the map with B said "OpenMap has been blocked from an action only available to the Blizzard UI"
  (and Disable on that message could crash the game). The Gamepad UI sets the controller's buttons
  again on every map change, and on OpenMap's map those changes run as OpenMap's code, which the game
  then blocks from closing the map. Until OpenMap can work with the Gamepad UI without that, it says
  so once in chat and stays out of the map while the Gamepad UI is on; swap to mouse and keyboard and
  OpenMap's map is back.
- **The minimap's detail follows unexplored areas.** Zooming in, it drew over land you haven't
  explored as it is: on Hide, Moonglade, the land round Ironforge or Hillsbrad looked explored
  straight away; on Darken, the unexplored parts of zones you've been to came up undarkened. Up
  close, unexplored land is now blank parchment (Hide) or darkened (Darken), the minimap's detail
  with it, as from further out; on Hide a cave under it stays underground.
- **Santiago Reyes's coastline round Silithus and Ahn'Qiraj.** His painting leaves its sea clear, and
  past his coast, where the game's own map has land, the map's blank paper showed through: an orange
  band down Silithus's and Ahn'Qiraj's west coast in place of his shallows. His shallows and the ink
  line he draws off the shore show now, there and round every painted gap's coast.
- **Santiago Reyes's mountains south of Hyjal at full strength.** Between Felwood, Ashenvale and
  Azshara, his painting of the land below Mount Hyjal looked washed out, its mountains faint ghosts on
  blank paper up to a straight line under Hyjal's map. The zones' blank parchment from the sheet he
  painted on had been left over his finished painting there; it shows now as he painted it.
- **Caves come up at the usual deepest zoom.** A cave's map surfaced only once it nearly filled the
  view, which at the default deepest zoom (48x, where a mine is a speck) most never could: clicking
  a dungeon entrance glided in and stopped short of it. Over a cave the zoom now goes on past the
  deepest setting until its map fills the window, and a cave comes up as it fills a quarter of it.
- **Blizzard's cave maps show their whole cave.** Their outlines were traced from the maps' pale
  floors and lost darker rooms and passages' ends: Night Web's Hollow's great chamber, Burning Blade
  Coven's west loop, Ban'ethil Barrow Den's lower tunnel and more. They're traced now from where the
  caves' own rooms lie in the game, leaving out only the page's title ribbon and corner knots.
- **The map window resizes by its corners again.** OpenMap put the window back to its saved size
  in the middle of a drag; now the drag sizes it, the map staying where it is on screen as more or
  less of it comes into the window, and the drop lays it out at that same scale, with no jump.
- **Townsfolk without Questie**: they come from Questie's database, so without Questie the menu
  says so instead of offering switches that showed nothing, and turning one on says so once in chat.
- **Zones' edges against the sea and the painted gaps.** A zone's own map is drawn whole to its
  frame on land, so its coasts and mountains no longer fade out early into an orange band of blank
  land (Arathi's east coast) or a grey smudge of sea (Arathi's mountains above the Wetlands); where
  it paints the sea up to its frame, the sea fades in from the frame instead of stopping in a
  straight line (Eastern Plaguelands' east coast). Mountain strokes mistaken for a printed name no
  longer cut holes in a zone's map (the brown blot at Thoradin's Wall), and past its own land a zone
  gives way to Santiago Reyes's painted gaps where they reach.
- **Ironforge's map whole up close.** The Mystic Ward, the Forlorn Cavern, the Hall of Explorers and
  the Gates were faded out into the mountain: the city's map faded out in a round from its middle,
  and Ironforge's wards reach right out to its frame. It's cut to the city instead, as the
  Undercity's is, with Dun Morogh's mountain round it.
- **Ironforge's minimap detail up close.** Zooming in on Stormwind brings in the game's minimap;
  on Ironforge only the painted map showed: the game's minimap there, outside, is the mountain over
  the city, so OpenMap kept it off. Now the game's own minimap of the city inside (what your minimap
  shows walking through it) comes in over Ironforge's map as you zoom in, as the minimap does over
  Stormwind; the Undercity's too.
- **The Wetlands' Excavation Site stays hidden until you've found it.** With Unexplored areas on
  Hide, the painted mountains south of Whelgar's Excavation Site showed WoW Forever's new valley
  there (green, with paths and a lake) before you'd been anywhere near it. It's blank parchment now
  until you've explored Whelgar's Excavation Site or Angerfang Encampment, the parts of the
  Wetlands' map over it (the game itself keeps no record of exploring the valley), close up too; on
  Darken it's darkened until then.
- **Fade while moving** faded for a moment and then came back: the game's own map fade (held off
  while OpenMap's runs) kept setting the map back to full on every frame you moved. OpenMap's fade
  now stays.
- **Map size** in the map's menu ran away as you dragged it: it scales the window the menu is in, so
  the slider moved under the cursor. The size now changes when you let go.
- The continents' names lost their glow each time you zoomed and flickered back on: they keep it now
  (the seas' names still rest theirs while the map moves, which keeps zooming smooth).
- Blizzard's quest areas trailed the map as you zoomed and sprang back when you stopped: each is
  now drawn where the map is at that step.
- **Quests from every zone** follow the map's own **Quest Objectives** switch: with it off, OpenMap's
  quest icons go too, as Blizzard's do.
- The menu's **Minimap button** row has its icon (it showed none: the icon it named isn't in the
  game).

## v0.5.0-beta (2026-10-16)

### New

- **Khaz Modan's blank land painted**: the stretches between Dun Morogh, Wetlands, Loch Modan,
  Searing Gorge and the Badlands that no zone map covers, and the coast round them, painted by hand
  by Santiago Reyes in the zone maps' own style, from Blizzard's art and following the game's
  terrain (used with his permission). The first of the gaps between zones to be filled; Options'
  **Filled gaps** turns them off.
- **Maps of City of Dalaran and Excavation Site: Wetlands**, drawn by Santiago Reyes and used with
  his permission: click their entrances in Alterac Mountains and the Wetlands (they opened on a blank
  page before). "Map by Santiago Reyes" at their foot, as with his others.
- **Airships to Zephras Isle**: the flying boats at the Dalaran skydock (Alterac Mountains) and in
  Mulgore are on the map; click one and Zephras Isle's map opens in the window, as a dungeon's does,
  and Back takes you to the world where you were. (Under the Boats switch.)
- **Maps of Ruins of Lordaeron and The Hall of Thanes**, two of WoW Forever's own dungeons, which
  the game has no map of: drawn by Santiago Reyes and used with his permission. Click their
  entrances in Undercity and Ironforge; the map shows "Map by Santiago Reyes" at its foot.
- **Dungeon Journal**: with Exehn's Dungeon Journal installed, a dungeon's map has **Open in Dungeon
  Journal** on its Bosses tab, and clicking an entrance can open its page there instead of its map
  (the menu's **Entrances open Dungeon Journal**, or Options). Its map still opens where Dungeon
  Journal has no page for it.
- **Dungeon quests without Questie**: the Quests tab works with Dungeon Journal or NeedRoll too, as a
  button that opens the dungeon's quests in it. With more than one installed, Options' **Dungeon
  quests from** picks which (the first installed: Questie, then Dungeon Journal, then NeedRoll).
- **The OpenMap button off the map, if you like**: **OpenMap button on the map** (the menu's Look tab)
  hides it and the favourites. The menu is still a click away: OpenMap is in the minimap's AddOns
  list, and there's a **minimap button** if you want one (the Look tab, or Options). Click for the map
  and its menu, right-click for the options window, drag it round the minimap; /openmap works too.
- **A choice the first time the map opens** on a new install: **Classic** (unexplored areas
  hidden, no dungeon or flight master icons, no zone levels, the favourite buttons folded away) or
  **OpenMap** (as it comes). Settings you already have aren't asked about or changed;
  /openmap welcome asks again. Suggested in #24.
- **Your arrow on top, or off**: the player arrow is drawn over every other icon on the map (quest
  givers, Questie's and other addons' icons), so you can always see which way you're facing
  (suggested in #31); your party's markers come up with it. Or take it off the world map (the menu's
  Show tab, **Your arrow**) and find your way old-school by the land around you: your party still
  shows, and so does the minimap.
- **Icons from zoom**: a slider (the menu's Look tab, or Options) for the zoom the icons for places
  (dungeons, boats, zeppelins and flight masters) show from: 1x has them from the whole world, higher
  keeps the map clean further out. Auto, as before, brings each in at its own zoom. Townsfolk never
  come in further out than their own; your pins, drawings and party always show.
- OpenMap shows under a **Map** category in the game's AddOns list.

### Improved

- **Map frame rate cap** (the menu's Look tab, or Options; off unless you set it): the frame rate at
  most while the map is open. A big map draws many layers over the whole screen every frame; at 60
  the graphics card does about half the work it does at 120 (reported: a full-screen 4K map doubling
  the card's power). Your own frame rate setting comes back as the map closes.
- Up close, a layer of the paper grain that has faded out is no longer drawn.
- **Report a problem** sends you to OpenMap's comments on CurseForge for now, to post its code in
  (What's new's link goes to OpenMap's CurseForge page too).
  Its window, and the bench's and the map notes' to copy from, are in the map window's own frame.
- **Dungeons, boats and zeppelins each have their own switch** in the menu's Show tab and in
  Options, so you can keep dungeon and raid entrances and hide the boats or zeppelins. A kind that's
  off takes its routes with it when routes are shown. Your old setting carries over to all three.
- **Out of a city to its zone**: right-click out of Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Orgrimmar,
  Thunder Bluff or Undercity and the map goes out to the zone around it (Elwynn Forest, Dun Morogh
  ...), as it does from anywhere else in that zone, not the whole continent.
- **Azeroth Tripview**: its live ships and docks are kept above the map's art. For other addons,
  OpenMapAPI (version 2) can now place a point of the game's world anywhere on the stitched map,
  for frames they put on the world map themselves (docs/api.md).

### Fixed

- Zooming in quickly, the zones no longer flicker to blank parchment for a moment: the map's
  pre-drawn tiles now stay until every zone coming into view has its art in.
- Opening a dungeon's map no longer can raise a Lua error the first time (when the map window
  changed size as it opened, as in full screen).
- **With a gamepad**: the cursor stays where you put it. It jumped back to the middle of the map
  each time the map underneath changed (shortly after every zoom or pan), so the next zoom was about
  the middle. And in combat, a dungeon's or Zephras Isle's map waits until you're out of it (a line
  in chat says so): opened then, the game set the map's gamepad buttons again in a way it blocks in
  combat, which could leave them wrong until a /reload.
- **WoW Forever's boats** are on the map, with their docks and routes: Steamwheedle Port (Tanaris)
  to Powderfuse Port (Riverglades), for both factions; Stormwind to Auberdine; and Menethil Harbor
  to Southshore and Auberdine, which takes the place of the old Menethil to Auberdine boat.
- **WoW Forever's flight masters**: Farholde Keep and Powderfuse Port for the Alliance, Rog'mar and
  Powderfuse Port for the Horde, with their flights (Farholde Keep to Powderfuse Port, Lakeshire,
  Morgan's Vigil and Thelsamar; Rog'mar to Stonard, Kargath, Flame Crest and Hammerfall). The flight
  network now comes from WoW Forever's own tables, which have moved Stormwind's flight master and
  redrawn some of the classic flights.
- **The close-up minimap on towns by the sea and on islands**: Menethil Harbor, Southshore,
  Theramore, Booty Bay's shallows, Teldrassil and Darnassus, Feathermoon Stronghold. It was cut to
  the continent map's coarse outline of the land, which leaves out what that map draws as sea; it
  now takes in each zone map's own land too.
- **No retail Eversong Woods or Zul'Aman over Quel'Thalas**: the minimap is now only the tiles the
  game itself draws (those its own world map file lists), which also leaves out other versions' sea
  far west of Dun Morogh and east of Wetlands, and the Draenei isles off Kalimdor.
- Blizzard's classic maps drawn in the land between zones are placed where WoW Forever places those
  zones. They were placed by Mists of Pandaria Classic's tables, whose zones are Cataclysm's, so
  The Barrens' was drawn at Northern Barrens' size and Stonetalon Mountains', Silithus', Badlands',
  Dun Morogh's and Azshara's were off, showing copies of their mountains beside the real ones.
  Cataclysm's Hillsbrad Foothills (Alterac taken in) and a different drawing of Mulgore are no longer
  used.
- The cave maps of four places WoW Forever doesn't have are gone: Greymane Manor (Gilneas),
  Spitescale Cavern (the Echo Isles as Cataclysm remade them), and Legion's Keeper's Rest and
  Karazhan Catacombs.
- **Books on Map Forever**'s book icons show on the stitched map: they were drawn under its art.
  Which ones show is still the addon's own choice (those of the zone or continent the map is on).
- The zone you're looking at has its name over the map again when you hover it, where the game
  names no place in it (Silverpine Forest's had gone; reported in #25). With Zone levels off, zone
  names still show, without their levels.
- **Move Any** owns the map window: with it, OpenMap's title bar, resize grips and saved place
  stand down, so Move Any's own drag and resize work on the map again (reported in #23). The map
  size slider and Reset size and place are off then.
- A city's own map that went missing (Ironforge showing only Dun Morogh's painting of it, until a
  /reload: reported in #30) is shown again when you reopen the map, and the map's check of what's in
  view no longer stays stuck if it stopped part way. (A safeguard: what hid it isn't known yet.)

## v0.4.0-beta (2026-10-16)

### New

- **Dungeon maps.** Click a dungeon's entrance for its own map, drawn from the game's own art (WoW
  Forever's map never shows it), right in the map window. Zoom with the wheel, drag to pan, and step
  through its floors with the arrows, the floor list or the side panel's Floors tab, which shows each
  floor as a small picture. Where several share an entrance you pick one; Blackrock Spire, Dire Maul
  and Scarlet Monastery are listed by wing, each opening on its own floor. Right-click, Escape or
  Back takes you back to the world where you were. 25 dungeons and raids have maps; WoW Forever's
  own new dungeons open on a blank page until the game has art for them.
- **A side panel for each dungeon**, in the quest log's place and look, as a tab beside the log: its
  floors, its bosses, its quests (with Questie: their level, done or in your log, objectives on
  hover) and its loot, where we recommend NeedRoll by mikebvs (a boss's row opens it). Put the quest
  log away and the dungeon's map has the whole view; the tabs at the map's edge bring the log back.
- **Dungeon entrances** show their level range, coloured for your level (the menu's Level ranges
  hides them). WoW Forever's own dungeons are on the map: City of Dalaran, The Drowned City,
  Excavation Site: Wetlands, The Hall of Thanes and Ruins of Lordaeron so far.
- **Map pins**, as many as you like: Ctrl-click the map (or Drop a pin) for one with a note and a
  colour. Its card follows it (Blizzard's waypoint, and TomTom's), shares it with your group, guild
  or a friend (other OpenMap players are asked first), gives a code to paste anywhere, or deletes
  it. The Pins list (/openmap pins) has them all, for all your characters.
- **The quill:** draw on the map with a pen, lines, arrows, circles and raid marks, in six inks and
  three widths (the menu's Quill, or /openmap draw). Your drawings are kept, and a pin's card can
  draw on that pin.
- **Tabs at the map's edge** for the OpenMap button and your favourites, in WoW Forever's own tab art.
  Drag the OpenMap tab anywhere round the edge; the arrow by it folds your favourites away. "Buttons
  as edge tabs" (the menu's Look tab) puts them back in the corner.
- **Report a problem draws:** in two steps, draw where it's wrong (with the quill, or on a dungeon's
  page), then say what's wrong, for a code to paste into a GitHub issue.
- **When reopening the map:** center on the player (the default for new installs), always restore
  the previous view, or restore it only while you're still in view. Middle-click the map to center
  on yourself at the same zoom. Thanks, C-Clymer (#19)!
- **What's new** in the game, laid out like the quest log: each version's changes, Newer and Older,
  and where to find OpenMap on GitHub.
- **For addon authors:** `OpenMapAPI` (docs/api.md), to place things on the stitched world, hear
  when the view moves or a dungeon's map opens, and add a switch to the OpenMap menu or a section
  to a dungeon's panel.

### Improved

- One place for OpenMap's settings: /openmap (and the game's AddOns settings page) opens the map's
  own menu, now with every setting in three tabs (On the map, Look, More) in the game's own settings
  look. The Look tab's sliders sit in two columns, with Defaults and Reset size and place under them.
- Other addons' map icons placed through HereBeDragons (TomTom, gatherers, notes addons) show on
  the stitched map from every zone in view, and Leatrix Maps' icons show above its art.
- Teldrassil's coast is whole, the great tree's roots all round the island, and Thunder Bluff comes
  in sooner, cut to its plan, under Mulgore's banner for it. (Changed textures: restart the game.)
- Darkened unexplored areas reach all of a zone's land and fade softly at their edges, with no hard
  lines or boxes in zones you've been to; cities you haven't found are darkened (or hidden) too.
  (Changed textures: restart the game.)
- The minimap's detail comes in after the same turns of the wheel in any window, full screen too,
  and a tall or very wide window brings the zones in by how much of the world is in view.
- The map pin's card, the pins list, What's new and the menu's dropdowns have the game's own frames
  and dropdown look; the coordinates are steady black boxes in the bottom-right corner; Find me has
  a crosshair; tooltips say plainly what a click does.
- The quest log's Back (from a quest's details) leaves the map where you're looking. The OpenMap
  menu shows over the quest log and stays put while you drag the map window, and the window's
  bottom-right corner is easier to grab with the quest log open.
- "Reset sliders to defaults" in Options, and Defaults under the menu's sliders.
- OpenMap gives back the game settings it holds: turn off its coordinates and Blizzard's come back,
  and at logout the map fade and coordinates are the game's own again.

### Fixed

- No more "action blocked" errors opening the map (or the quest log updating it) in combat
  (reported by C-Clymer in #19).
- Clicking a quest on another continent opens it at the first click.
- Zooming in on a zone no longer flashes plain parchment between its art from afar and close in.
- The quest log's button stays over the map's parchment border when you zoom right out, and its
  arrows point the way the log goes.
- A click on the window's resize corner without dragging no longer resets the view.
- Closing the map in the middle of resizing or moving it no longer leaves the window following the
  mouse.
- The menu's tabs no longer show another tab's names behind their own, and its search results
  aren't see-through.
- Clearing or replacing a map pin removes its TomTom waypoint.
- A flight route to or from a flight master you haven't learned says so.

## v0.3.0-beta (2026-10-14)

- "Minimap detail from" (a slider in the menu, under Deepest zoom, and in Options' Up close) sets how
  far in the minimap's detail starts to mix in: lower comes in sooner, higher later (20x by default);
  at 1x it's there from the whole world. Further out than the game's own minimap tiles can be
  drawn, smaller copies of them show, crossfading to the tiles as you zoom in. (New textures:
  restart the game.)
- "Minimap opacity" (in the menu too, and Options' "Minimap detail, most opacity"): the most the
  minimap's detail ever shows, at any zoom.
- More coastal and border detail: each zone map now shows everything it paints
  round its own land (the sea off its coasts with its shallows, hatching and islets, the
  mountains and coasts beyond its border), shared out with its neighbours so each place shows
  one painting, handing over smoothly at the maps' frames. Land no map paints is plain
  parchment, which the art fades into, instead of the neighbours' edges blurred across it.
  The zone maps' sea names, their names for the neighbouring zones and their compass roses
  are left out. (Changed textures: restart the game.)
- Improved compatibility with other map addons: they work alongside OpenMap instead of fighting
  it. On the stitched map the art and the view are OpenMap's, and the rest of theirs keeps working;
  their map art shows on dungeon maps as before. At login OpenMap names only the options that
  still clash, not the whole addon.
- Gamepad: on the stitched map the right stick zooms at a steady pace all the way in and out
  (it crawled zoomed in), about the gamepad's cursor; A zooms into the zone under the cursor and
  X out a map, as clicks do, instead of changing the map underneath; the coordinates, the hover
  label, the zone highlight and the boat routes follow the gamepad's cursor. Its cursor shows
  the tooltips of OpenMap's buttons and map icons, and A presses them: the OpenMap button, the
  favourites, the menu (a slider goes to the value under the cursor), the dungeon, flight and
  other icons.
- "Fade unexplored areas" is now "Darken unexplored areas": the land you haven't explored is much
  darker and greyer, instead of faded toward the parchment, and a zone you haven't found at all is
  darkened whole from every zoom, the whole world's too, with the mountains and land round it, so a
  stretch you haven't been to is dark from one zone to the next. Only land is darkened, not the
  sea the zone maps paint round their coasts. (New textures: restart the game.)
- Panning and zooming make far less Lua garbage (OpenMap's view and zoom updates reuse their
  tables instead of making new ones every frame), so the game has less to clear up as you use the map.
- Clicking a quest in the quest log that's in another zone opens it again: the map goes to the
  quest's zone and stays there. It flickered and went back to the list, because the map was put
  back where you'd last closed it. Reopening where you left off now only applies when you open the
  map, not when Blizzard changes the map while it's open (the quest log, the zone dropdown), and
  not when the map opens on a quest's zone from the quest tracker.
- A quest's details in the quest log reach the foot of a window taller than Blizzard's, with more
  room for the quest's text, instead of stopping short with an empty strip under the buttons.
- The OpenMap button is its icon alone, right in the map's bottom-left corner.
- Zoomed in, only the tiles of each zone near the view are drawn and loaded, not every tile of
  every zone it touches, and panning works out what to show only now and then instead of every
  frame (the sea and the paper grain stay put as you pan, too). Less for the game to draw and lay
  out as you move about.
- The zones' art is baked into world tiles (made by a script from Blizzard's map art, as the map
  draws it), so from the continents' zoom in to a zone the map draws a few dozen tiles instead of
  hundreds of masked textures; closer in than the tiles' own pixels, the zones' art is drawn live
  as before. Changing the colour match, or hiding unexplored areas, uses the live art throughout.
  (New textures, 69 MB: restart the game.)
- The continents' and seas' names cost far less to pan and zoom: only those near the view are
  drawn, and their halo takes half as many font strings (each copy's shadow is the one opposite
  it), the same to look at. Panning over a continent with its names showing was a third of the
  map's frame time on a wide screen. While the map moves (zooming or panning) their halo rests
  (every letter is drawn again at its new size on each frame of a zoom, and laid out again on each
  of a pan, and the halo was eight of its nine), back as soon as the map stops.
- Questie's icons from the neighbouring zones are placed up to half the map's width round it,
  not a whole width: every icon on the map is laid out again on each frame of a pan or zoom (231
  of them cost 7 ms a frame on a wide screen). Those further off show once the map switches to
  their zone.
- Panning and zooming no longer lay out the thousands of zone textures that aren't showing (the
  live art the baked tiles stand in for, the tiles off the view): a hidden one lets go of its place
  on the map until it shows again. With vsync off on a wide screen, all of OpenMap's art cost 20 ms
  of a 41 ms panning frame, 8 of them in art nobody could see.
- Up close over Orgrimmar the minimap's detail is much fainter (15% at most, from 50%): the city's own
  plan, which comes in from further out than the other cities', leads there.
- OpenMap's icons (flight masters, dungeons, the player arrow ...) are on the map's view instead of
  its canvas: they keep their size on screen by themselves, instead of their layer being rescaled
  on every frame of a zoom (which laid every icon out again: 6.6 ms of a zooming frame).
- `/openmap bench` times the map where it's slow (still, panning and zooming, at several zooms, then
  with each part of it off in turn) and gives the results to copy into an issue.
- The OpenMap menu's close button is easier to hit, and Escape closes the menu.
- "Report a problem" isn't only about the map: circling a spot is optional (just click Next), it
  works on dungeon maps too, and the issue form says so.
- The debug overlay also shows what can pile up over a session: the UI's Lua memory and how fast it
  grows, the map's pins (every addon's, and the kind there's most of), how much zone art is loaded,
  how many regions are placed live, which parts make the most Lua garbage a second (rescaling
  every addon's pins, switching maps, OpenMap's own updates), and which addons hold the most
  memory and grow it fastest.

## v0.2.0-beta (2026-10-11)

- Map notes (Tools → Map notes, `/openmap notes`) replace the paint tool: paint an area (or
  click) and say what's there, as a "fix this", "look into this" or "idea"; a list of them all
  (click one to go there) and Export, which gives them all as text to paste where they're needed.
  `tools/map-preview/notes.py` renders them out of game. Older paint mark-up becomes notes.
- A debug overlay (Tools → Debug overlay, `/openmap debug`): the frame rate on the map, a graph of
  frame times, the worst frame, and what OpenMap's own updates cost.
- The quest log shows on the full-screen map too: the Quest log button (and the arrow button in
  the corner, as on the windowed map) puts it over the map's right side. Its background no longer
  ends in a line when the window is taller than Blizzard's.
- Blizzard's quest areas (the blue shapes) keep up with the map as it zooms, instead of a step behind.
- The OpenMap button and the favourites' row are in the map's bottom-left corner, along its
  foot (over the coordinates when they show); favourites are icon buttons in Blizzard's
  action-button frame, glowing while they're on.
- The OpenMap menu is laid out afresh in the map window's own frame: the actions as tiles with
  icons, an icon by each setting, bronze rules between the parts. Find me, Drop a pin,
  Report a problem, Options and a new Quest log button (hide or show the quest log beside the
  map, out of combat) can be starred onto the map too.
- "Minimap detail" (in the menu's Up close and in Options) turns the minimap's detail off at
  the closest zoom, so the painted map is all you see.
- The deepest zoom is a slider in the menu, and goes to 192x (it was 96x at most).
- The window resizes from its bottom-left corner as well as the bottom-right, and both grips
  are easier to catch.
- Favourite settings: the star by each setting in the OpenMap menu puts it on the map as a
  button of its own, beside the OpenMap button (lit while it's on; click to switch it,
  right-click to take it off).
- The parchment border's edges are laid as copies of their piece at its own length, every other
  one mirrored, instead of one piece stretched along the whole side; the corners are as they were.
- Orgrimmar and Undercity keep their own maps' name banners: up close that's the city's title,
  and their zone's big banner for them (Durotar's, Tirisfal's) gives way to it as you zoom in,
  instead of covering the city. (Changed textures: restart the game.)
- No more straight-edged patches over the zones zoomed out (east of the Barrens, Stranglethorn ...):
  the blank paper in the gaps between zones reaches only a little way under the zones, not to
  the edge of the square it's drawn in. (Changed textures: restart the game.)
- The ocean past the world map keeps the world sea's own colours, carried outward, instead of
  one flat grey-green. (New texture: restart the game.)
- The OpenMap button stays in the map's top-left corner (an addon's frame across the map
  could push it off the right edge).
- Going full screen and back (or resizing the window) keeps the view you were looking at,
  instead of jumping to where the map was last closed.
- Resizing the window keeps its top-left corner (and the OpenMap menu) in place with the map
  size option off 100%, so the corner stays under the cursor; the resize grip sits in the
  window's outer corner, clear of the quest log button, and is easier to catch.
- Reopening a moved or resized map shows it in its place at once (not Blizzard's first).
- The menu's pin button works wherever you click (on Blizzard's map icons too, where only
  Ctrl-click did), with the pin cursor while it's on.
- On the stitched map the waypoint is always OpenMap's pin: Shift-clicking Blizzard's there was
  blocked ("only available to the Blizzard UI"). Shift-click OpenMap's to share it in chat.
- No more square patches and straight bands in the sea off Stranglethorn and Wetlands: the
  gap fill's borrowed paintings of the land between zones stay on land, and a zone's painted
  sea fades out well inside its frame. (New textures: restart the game.)
- Zone art fades in as it loads (zooming or panning fast onto new zones), instead of popping in.
- Over the major cities' own maps the minimap shows at half strength at most, so the city plan leads.
- "Dim unexplored areas" is now "Fade unexplored areas": those areas fade 60% of the way to the
  zone's blank parchment (its unexplored look) instead of darkening.
- Faster panning and zooming: map icons off the view (townsfolk, flight masters ...) are
  hidden, and blank tiles of the filled-in land aren't drawn.
- Opening the map loads only the zone art in view (and none until zone detail shows), instead
  of the whole world's; `/openmap status` shows how long the last openings took.
- Questie's icons stay on the map when it switches to a zone: Questie's map library places
  them from world coordinates that are off on Forever's zone and continent maps, so there
  each icon is placed (or moved) from Forever's own map positions. They're also lifted above the stitched art:
  Questie fixes its icons' frame levels, which put them under the zone art up close. `/openmap status`
  shows how many Questie icons there are and who placed them.
- The parchment border frames the map only when zoomed right out, fading as you zoom in.
- Blizzard's glow on the zone under the cursor is off by default on the stitched map
  ("Zone highlight on hover" in the menu brings it back).
- The map window's portrait is OpenMap's icon while the map is stitched; the OpenMap button
  sits beside Blizzard's floor dropdown instead of under it.
- Opening the map sets its view once (straight to where you left off), or not at all if
  it's still there, instead of Blizzard's reset to the whole world and back; the
  close-up softening no longer recolours the whole map when it first builds a zone.
- Zone art coming into view loads over a few frames instead of stalling one; `/openmap status`
  names the slowest steps of the close-up update, and how much of opening the map is OpenMap's.
- Undercity: Tirisfal's "Undercity" banner sits over the city until close in, as Orgrimmar's
  does. You can zoom 1.5x further in cities, and the minimap mixes in over the cities in the
  open. Undercity's and Ironforge's own maps are drawn over the minimap, which shows the
  surface there, wherever they are in the view.
- Blackrock Mountain's inside (its main floor) surfaces from further out as you zoom in on it.
- Cave and dungeon-entrance maps stay while they're on screen (they no longer fade as you pan
  away from them); only the dimming of the surface follows the one you're centred on.
- Undercity's map is cut to the city's plan (its quarters, the Ruins, the Sewers), so Tirisfal's
  painting shows round it instead of the city map's own parchment.
- "Fade while moving" (0-90%, in Options; on / off in the map's menu) replaces "Don't fade while
  moving": the map fades smoothly while you move, never while the mouse is over it.

## v0.1.0-beta (2026-10-09)

First public beta. One seamless world map for WoW Forever: every zone stitched
together, Blizzard's own art, with dungeon entrances and caves, flight paths,
boat and zeppelin routes, townsfolk and rares (with Questie), search, map pins,
group members, a movable and resizable window, and a "Report a problem" button.
The continent and sea names are lettered live; land Forever has no zone map for is
drawn from Blizzard's classic and pre-Cataclysm maps of it, or left as blank parchment.
