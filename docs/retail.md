# OpenMap for retail

OpenMap runs on retail World of Warcraft (Midnight, `## Interface: 120105`) as well as WoW Forever,
from one codebase: retail's toc is `OpenMap/OpenMap_Mainline.toc`, its data `OpenMap/Data/Retail/`,
its textures `OpenMap/Media/Textures/Retail/` (see [development.md](development.md#clients)). Its zip
is a file of its own on CurseForge (`--client=retail`, [releasing.md](releasing.md)).

## How retail's map differs

Retail's maps aren't WoW Forever's, and the map is built from them differently:

- **The world.** Azeroth's map (947) holds twelve continents, not two, and its art is 3840 x 2560
  (Forever's 1002 x 668). A zone is about half as wide on it, so the layers' fades go by twice the zoom
  (`Data/Retail/Client.lua`'s `zoom`), and the deepest zoom goes twice as far.
- **Which maps are stitched** comes from `Data/Retail/World.lua` (`tools/map-data/world.py`, where
  its rules are): the open-world zones on the game's navigation bar, one version of each. Left out:
  Vashj'ir (under the sea), Khaz Algar's underground (right under the Isle of Dorn on Azeroth's map),
  Quel'Thalas before Midnight (game map 530), class halls, scenarios, and the places Azeroth's map
  doesn't place (Outland, Draenor, the Shadowlands, Argus, the Maelstrom, Nazjatar, K'aresh,
  Undermine, the Emerald Dream ...): Blizzard's own map shows those as it always has.
- **The art is painted whole.** Since the Cataclysm a zone's base art is the whole zone (its
  explored-area pieces are the same art again), and the world's and continents' art paint their own
  sea. So there's no sea of OpenMap's, no explored-area pieces over the zones, and no gap filling,
  colour matching or hand-cleaned art: the map is Blizzard's art as it is, fitted together by masks
  traced from it (`tools/map-preview/territory.py`): each continent's art over the world's (its sea
  too, but never over another continent's land and shallows), each zone's on its own land and what it
  paints round it over its continent's.
- **The zones come in continent by continent.** Each continent's zones fade in where its own art runs
  out of pixels (`Client.lua`'s `detailDensity`): Pandaria's and the Broken Isles' continent maps are
  coarse (1002 px wide), so their zones come in soon; Quel'Thalas' and the Dragon Isles' are fine, so
  theirs later. A zone that hasn't come in isn't drawn or loaded at all. The fade is slow (`detailFade`)
  and starts with no faint hint from further out (`detailHint`).
- **World positions** (flight masters, entrances, docks, the minimap) go through each game map's
  place on Azeroth's map (`World.lua`'s `yards`), worked out from the tables (`tools/uimap.py`).

## What comes from where

| Data | From | Made by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `World.lua` | the map tables | `tools/map-data/world.py` |
| `Places.lua` | the map tables; entrances from the encounter journal (`JournalInstanceEntrance`), docks from the map's own points of interest ("Boat to ..."); no `Reveal.lua` (no pieces drawn: `tools/clients.py`'s `pieces`) | `tools/map-data/build.py` |
| `Minimap.lua` | each game map's own world file | `tools/map-data/minimap.py` |
| `FlightData.lua` | the taxi tables | `tools/map-flights/flights.py` |
| `DungeonMaps.lua` | the dungeon maps and their floors in the map tables | `tools/map-dungeons/tables.py` |
| `Territories.lua`, `Tones.lua` and the masks | the zones' explored-area pieces and art | `tools/map-preview/territory.py` |
| `Caves.lua`, `MapCave/` | the cave maps (micro maps) on the stitched world | `tools/map-caves/build.py` |

Zone levels come from the game itself (`C_Map.GetMapLevels`), as its own map shows them.

## Regenerating

With retail's tables in a folder (`<db2>`: UiMap, UiMapArt, UiMapArtTile, UiMapArtStyleLayer,
UiMapAssignment, UiMapGroupMember, UiMapXMapArt, WorldMapOverlay, WorldMapOverlayTile, Map, AreaTable,
TaxiNodes, TaxiPath, TaxiPathNode, JournalInstance, JournalEncounter, JournalInstanceEntrance, AreaPOI,
from `https://wago.tools/db2/<Table>/csv?build=12.1.5.70448`) and a texture cache (`<tex>`):

```bash
export OPENMAP_CLIENT=retail
python -P tools/map-data/world.py <db2>
python -P tools/map-data/build.py <cache>          # (fetches its tables into <cache>)
python -P tools/map-data/minimap.py <cache>
python -P tools/map-flights/flights.py <db2> OpenMap/Data/Retail/FlightData.lua
python -P tools/map-dungeons/tables.py <db2>
python -P tools/map-preview/territory.py <db2> <tex>
python -P tools/map-caves/build.py <cave cache>
python -P tools/map-textures/make.py
python -P tools/map-art/border.py
python -P tools/map-textures/shared.py
```

The build is `tools/clients.py`'s; a new one needs its tables and a rerun of all of these.

### The zones' highlights (once, in game)

A zone's territory reaches out from its own land (its explored-area pieces) by a fixed distance. Its
whole area, as its continent's map draws it, is better: the glow the map shows on the zone under the
cursor. Where the game draws that glow is only known in game, so it's recorded there once:

1. In retail, with OpenMap on, type `/openmap highlights` (it takes a few seconds), then `/reload`.
2. `python -P tools/map-preview/highlights.py <WoW>/_retail_/WTF/Account/<account>/SavedVariables/OpenMap.lua`
   writes `tools/map-preview/highlights/retail.txt` (commit it: it's the game's own data).
3. Rerun `territory.py`: with the highlights, a zone's painting covers its whole area and reaches only a
   little past it (`REACH_AREA`), so zones meet along the continent map's own borders.

## Checking

As for Forever (lint, `run.py` plain / combat / secret), with `OPENMAP_CLIENT=retail`, and:

- `python -P tools/offline-test/world.py <db2>` builds the stitched world in the stub, with the map
  answering from the tables, sweeps the view over every continent, and prints the textures drawn at
  each zoom (it fails on any Lua error; run it for both clients after a change to the map code).
- `python -P tools/map-preview/whole.py <db2> <tex> <out> name=u,v,zoom ...` renders retail's stitched
  map out of game, as Stitch.lua draws it.

## Not done, or not known yet

- Nothing has been checked in game: the whole retail build needs a first look (and textures need a full
  client restart).
- Townsfolk (vendors, trainers, rares) and dungeon quests come from Questie, which retail doesn't have:
  the menu leaves townsfolk out; dungeon quests work through Dungeon Journal or NeedRoll if a retail
  version of either is installed.
- Four dungeon floors drawn larger than the classic 1002 x 668 (Battle of Dazar'alor, The Nokhud
  Offensive, Vault of the Incarnates' Valdrakken floor, Dawn of the Infinite) are left out of the
  dungeon view; The Nokhud Offensive has no other floor, so its entrance opens nothing.
- Khaz Algar's underground dungeons have no entrance pins (their zones aren't stitched).
- No shrunk minimap for the mid zooms (`MapMiniLOD`: the game's own tiles show from close in), no baked
  zone tiles (`MapZones`) and no lettered names: retail's art letters its own.
- The flight time estimate uses classic's flight speed.
- **Seams between zones.** Retail's zone maps are each toned their own way (Crystalsong Forest's
  yellow beside Dragonblight's snow), and with no colour matching (Forever's `MapBand` / `Grade.lua`)
  they show as patches where a zone's art hands over to the next or to the continent's, most at the
  zoom where the zones come in. A colour match made for retail's art is the next step.
- **Performance.** `tools/offline-test/world.py` counts at most about 820 art textures drawn, where
  the continents' art comes in (zoom 3; it's 3840 x 2560 a continent), and about 710 where the zones
  are in (zoom 13), against about 650 at Forever's worst: the zones coming in continent by continent and
  the tighter cull took retail's zone peak down from about 1,100. Measure with `/openmap bench` in game; if
  it's slow there, baked zone tiles (Forever's `MapZones`) are the cure, at a cost: retail's world
  units are four times smaller, so tiles fine enough to carry the zooms where the zones are in (6 to 8
  px per world unit) would add 100 to 200 MB to the download; at 4 px (about 50 MB) the live layers
  take over again near zoom 10, where the count is still high.
- From retail's UI source (the `live` branch of wow-ui-source), to look at in game:
  - its quest log shows its own Quests / Events / Map Legend tabs, which Forever hides: beside
    OpenMap's dungeon tabs there may be two "Quests";
  - the map's "World" button goes to the cosmic map (946), leaving the stitched map;
  - the zone highlight on hover ("Highlight the zone", off by default) only shows over the host
    map's own rectangle;
  - Blizzard's filter and pin buttons sit at the map's top right (the dungeon card is moved below
    them), and its own dungeon entrance pins are hidden while the map is stitched;
  - the gamepad cursor code is Forever's: on retail it does nothing.
- Three caves' masks came out as most of their page (their art is pale): they show as a parchment
  rectangle when they surface.
