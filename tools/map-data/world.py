# Builds OpenMap/Data/<client>/World.lua: which of the game's maps are stitched into the world, and
# how world positions land on it, from the game's map tables (UiMap, UiMapAssignment, UiMapXMapArt,
# UiMapArt, UiMapArtStyleLayer, UiMapArtTile, WorldMapOverlay, Map) as CSVs from wago.tools.
#
# A client with a world of its own (retail: twelve continents, and zones in several versions) needs
# it; WoW Forever's toc has none, and Stitch.lua takes every continent and zone on Azeroth's map, as
# it always has. Which maps:
#   - continents on Azeroth's map (947) with art, placed on it;
#   - zones under them with art and a place on 947, in the open world (their game map no instance),
#     shown on the game's own navigation bar (UIMapFlag.DoNotShowOnNavbar off);
#   - not a zone that only groups others (Stranglethorn Vale over its two halves), not a second
#     version of one (UiMap.AlternateUiMapGroup: the first is kept; a lower floor of the same place),
#     and not those in EXCLUDE (below, each with why);
#   - a zone without explored-area pieces that lies within another stitched zone (a city, a starting
#     area's own map) is drawn over it as a city (2); the rest are zones (1).
