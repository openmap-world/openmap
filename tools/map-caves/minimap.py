# Builds OpenMap/Data/CaveMinimap.lua: every cave and underground area on the two continents, as
# the game's own minimap draws it inside (its WMOs' minimap textures, WMOMinimapTexture). Blizzard
# made world-map art (micro maps, build.py) for only some of them; the rest have only this.
# Which WMOs are caves, and how they're placed: wmo.py.
#
# Left out: what a city's map shows (Stormwind's canals, Undercity, Ironforge) and what Blizzard's
# cave maps cover a third of or more (Data/Caves.lua: build.py first); pieces next to each other
# are one cave.
#
# And the underground cities (Ironforge, Undercity: Stitch.lua's UNDERGROUND_CITIES), whose minimap
# outside is the surface over them (the mountain, the ruins): the city's own WMO as the minimap
# draws it inside, for Close.lua to lay over the city's map up close. Not a cave by wmo.py's names
# (Forever's own files, numbered): the WMO placed in the city's box with rooms under the terrain.
#
#   OpenMap/Data/CaveMinimap.lua
#     MapCaveMinimap, per cave: continent, its box (yards), its pieces lowest floor first, each a
#     square (the block's picture and the transparent rest): file, centre (yards), side (yards),
#     rotation (radians, counter-clockwise on the map), and the picture's share of the square
#     (u1, v0: texcoords 0..u1, v0..1)
#     MapCityMinimap, [city uiMapID] = the same, for its WMO: every inside group, above ground or
#     under it (the Undercity's ways up to the ruins and its lifts are the city too)
#
# usage: python -P tools/map-caves/minimap.py <cache dir> [contact sheet.png]
#   (OPENMAP_WOW: the game's folder, to read its files there; see wmo.py)
